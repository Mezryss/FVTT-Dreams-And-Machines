## Licenses
The code for this system is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](LICENSE) license.

#### FontAwesome

> **License:** [Proprietary](https://fontawesome.com/license)
>
> There are a couple of important nuances to use of FontAwesome in this project.
>
> 1. The official FoundryVTT has a license to use and distribute FontAwesome Pro icons within their software. To my knowledge and based on information shared in the [FoundryVTT Discord Server](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt), this **_does not_** include systems developed for Foundry by third-party creators.
> 2. This system makes use of the FontAwesome Pro icons packaged with Foundry VTT. _This is allowable only because I have a FontAwesome Pro license._ No other seats are provided for contributors at this time.
>
> This means:
>
> 1. Contributors should not make use of FontAwesome Pro icons in the code they contribute to the project (because FontAwesome licenses are based on individual seats) unless they have a seat on a FontAwesome Pro license.
> 2. If you fork this project, you are responsible for either removing all uses of FontAwesome Pro icons, or purchasing an appropriate license.

#### Sheet Background Image
> **License:** [Pexels License](https://www.pexels.com/license/)
>
> The [image](images/dnm-bg.jpg) used for sheet backgrounds is modified (mostly just lightened, tiled, shrunk, and color-tweaked) from "[Close-up Photo of Gray Wall](https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-photo-of-gray-wall-2768398/)" by Milo Textures on Pexels.
